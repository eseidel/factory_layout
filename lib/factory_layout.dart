// A machine has a list of recipes and a buffer for inputs and outputs.
// Recipes are unique to a machine, so they don't really need to be separate.
// Machines also have a buffer for inputs and outputs.
// Buffer's shouldn't matter in this simulation.

// One problem is solving for how many machines are needed.
// Another problem is how to lay them out.
