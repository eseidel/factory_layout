A sample command-line application providing basic argument parsing with an entrypoint in `bin/`.


Ideally should offer layouts for factory construction based on a desired
production rate and a list of available machines.

Possibly also with some sort of tech-stack awareness where it can propose
a plan to minimize the amount of time to completion of research?

Needs to start with a given set of machines and propose a layout to produce
a given item at a given rate.

That rate could start at just being whatever the machine that produces
that item produces at.
